# ðŸ‘— Outfit Style Classifier
An AI-powered web application that classifies outfit images into categories like **Glasses/Sunglasses**, **Trousers/Jeans**, and **Shoes** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Flask.

## Demo
Upload an outfit image and instantly get the predicted category!

## Features

-  Outfit classification using a trained deep learning model
-  Real-time image prediction via web interface
-  Clean and intuitive UI with Flask
-  Transfer learning ready (MobileNet, ResNet compatible)
-  Trained on the [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)
